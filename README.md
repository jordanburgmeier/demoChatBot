# demoChatBot
<!-- i've got a sort of kitchen sink code happening right now here, but here is an attept at listing out some main functionality of this project

** Goals: **
take user input and then "respond" like a bot using javascript
UX/UI - wanted it to look like a texting app, or an AI chatbox 
try out some CSS annimation - thats how teh text bubbles pop out 


** I would like to add: **
functions that run based off a group of "commands" 
  ex: hi, hello, hey -- would all run the same greetings command
some more annimation... ? 
  if userInput.contains == "string"  --> animate this text bubble a certain way 

** functions **

1. if the input area > 0 AND the enter key is clicked, make a new chatBubble
2. 2. make the chatBubble, add to list
3. CheckInput --> looking for possibleInput ( this is a var on link 189)
4. previousINput --> a weird yes/no situation for how bot responds to follow up Q/A

honestly the code is commented so much, check it out there 



-->
